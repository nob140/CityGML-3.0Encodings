LocalCRS_CityGML3.0.gml | This file demonstrates the use of a local engineering coordinate reference system in CityGML. The example shown here was taken from the CityGML 2 standard and was updated to comply with the CityGML 3 standard.<br>This is a simple example based on ISO 19111 and its encoding in ISO 19136. The example provides an implicit transformation which is a translation of coordinates from a local coordinate system to the anchor point specified in the anchor definition. The example does not include rotation and scaling. Based on ISO 19111 and ISO 19136, more complex transformations including rotation and scaling can be expressed as well. | 3.0.0-draft.2021.12.01.1
