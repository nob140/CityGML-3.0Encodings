The test data in this folder demonstrates how to segment Roads into Sections and Intersections.

Each Section and Intersection consists of several (Auxiliary)TrafficSpaces and (Auxiliary)TrafficAreas that represent the ground surface of the (Auxiliary)TrafficSpaces in granularity 'way'.

The original data was provided by the Open Data Portal of the City of Melbourne: https://data.melbourne.vic.gov.au/

The PDF [citygml3_road_modelling_examples](../CityGML_3.0_transportation_data_from_Open_Data_Portal_Melbourne/citygml3_road_modelling_examples.pdf) contains additional information on the data set.
