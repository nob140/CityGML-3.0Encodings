(A) The CityModel element (type
CityModelType, substitutionGroup: gml:_FeatureCollection) shall only contain cityObjectMember elements (type: gml:FeaturePropertyType), app:appearanceMember elements (type: app:AppearancePropertyType), and gml:featureMember elements (type: gml:FeaturePropertyType) as feature members.
Source	CityGML 2.0 10.1.6 (1), p. 56
Interpretation	
[I.1] (A): Each CityModel element may only have cityObjectMember, app:appearanceMember or gml:featureMember child elements. This is already covered by the schema. Note: why also a general gml:featureMember child is allowed? Why not just cityObjectmember and app:appearanceMember, the ones that are found in the UML diagrams of the standard?

Short Desc	(Building --- BuildingPart)
Citation	
(A) If a building only consists of one (homogeneous) part, it shall be represented by the element Building.
(B) However, if a building is composed of individual structural segments, it shall be modelled as a Building element having one or more additional BuildingPart elements.
(C) Only the geometry and non-spatial properties of the main part of the building should be represented within the aggregating Building element.
Source	CityGML 2.0 10.3.9 (1), p. 78
Interpretation	[I.1] (A) + (B): How to model Building and BuildingPart? Currently the schema allows for a building to be modelled as Building with or without BuildingParts (containing in turn again BuildingParts..), but also a building to be modelled as a BuildingPart containing more BuildingParts and containing more BuildingParts and so on (so no Building super parent..). I think this second case is unwanted and could be resolved in schema by setting multiplicity of the aggregation of BuildingPart to _AbstractBuilding from "*" to "1..*". So that a BuildingPart ALWAYS needs to have a parent, is the parent again a BuildingPart then it in turn should also have AbstractBuilding parent.. this chain is only broken when a Building as top parent is met.
[I.2] (A) + (B): Even if this is implemented it is still allowed (by the schema) to model a building as a Building containing BuildingParts which again contain BuildingParts which again contain BuildingParts etc.. Also this Conformance Requirement CO-bldg:BU-001 does not explicitly say that this should not be the case. But maybe this is unwanted and should be enforced.

[I.3] (A) + (B): The Comment whether a building is one homogeneous part or composed of structural segments is not formalizable because "homogenous parts" and "structural elements" is unclear terminology which cannot be interpreted by a computer. Only possibility is perhaps by computing the convex hull of Buildings (that do not have BuildingParts) -> if the volume of the convex hull is much larger than the volume of the Building itself, could indicate that it should be modelled as a Building with BuildingParts, see image underneath. This building should be modelled with BuildingParts, the convexhull (or boundingvolume) is much larger than the volume of the building.

[I.4] (C): When a Building element contains a BuildingPart element WITH geometry, THEN the building element itself should also have geometry. Geometry means in this case: lodxSolid OR lodXMultiSurface (direct property or over boundedBy).

Definition	[D.1] from [I.1]: Each BuildingPart should have a Building ancestor (note: doesnt have to be direct parent)
[D.2] from [I.2] : Each BuildingPart should have a Building parent

[D.3] from [I.4] : When a Building element contains a BuildingPart element WITH geometry, THEN the building element itself should also have geometry. Geometry means in this case: lodxSolid OR lodXMultiSurface (direct property or over boundedBy).

Formalization	
[F.1] from [D.1]:

Schema:

Set the multiplicity of the aggregation of BuildingPart to _AbstractBuilding from "*" to "1..*" (Note that the multiplicities on the "not-arrow-side" of an association is not mapped in GML. So changing the UML model in this way would not have any schema effect. However, I understood that in cityGML 3.0 the UML diagram is going to be leading, so its something to take into account for the new version of cityGML).

Source	CityGML 2.0 10.3.9 (2), p. 78
Interpretation	
[I.1] (A): Each gml:posList child-element of lod0FootPrint/lod0RoofEdge should contain a number of coordinate entries that is a multiple of 3. Each gml:pos and gml:pointProperty childelement of lod0FootPrint/lod0RoofEdge should contain exactly 3 coordinate entries.

   <gml:posList>
     1 2 3
   </gml:posList>
Not Allowed:

   <gml:posList>
     1 2 3 4
   </gml:posList>
Allowed:

   <gml:posList>
    1 2 3 4 5 6
   </gml:posList>

Note: I believe these are the only two ways of specifiying the coordinates for lod0FootPrint and lod0RoofEdge. Is that correct? EDIT: No.. there are more ways but because it is a heuristic anyway this is considered enough.

[I.2] (A) if the gml:posList and gml:pos as child-elements of lod0FootPrint/lod0RoofEdge include the srsDimension attribute, it must be set to 3. So it remains an optional attribute but if it is used, it should indicate 3D geometry

[I.3] (B): For each surface from [I.1], the height values of the coordinate tuples belonging to the same surface shall be identical within a certain (application dependent) threshold value. This requirements can only be verfied by geometry tests ( --> GE-ns:YY-ZZZZ, tbd). In schematron it is only formalizable that the height coordinates are all exactly identical.

(A) Starting from LOD2, the exterior shell of an _AbstractBuilding may be semantically decomposed into _BoundarySurface elements using the boundedBy property (type: BoundarySurfacePropertyType) of _AbstractBuilding. Only RoofSurface, WallSurface, GroundSurface, OuterCeilingSurface, OuterFloorSurface and ClosureSurface as subclasses of _BoundarySurface are allowed.

(B) The boundedBy property (not to be confused with the gml:boundedBy property) shall not be used if the building is only represented in LOD1.

(C) If the exterior shell is represented by _BoundarySurface elements, an additional geometric representation as volume or surface model using the lodXSolid and lodXMultiSurface, X ‚àà [2..4], properties shall not explicitly define the geometry, but has to reference the according components of the gml:MultiSurface element of _BoundarySurface within each LOD using the XLink concept of GML 3.1.1.

Interpretation	
[I.1] (A) When using the boundedBy property of _AbstractBuilding only RoofSurface, WallSurface, GroundSurface, OuterCeilingSurface, OuterFloorSurface and ClosureSurface as subclasses of _BoundarySurface are allowed.

[I.2] (B): DE: (B) ist logisch gesehen bl√∂dsinnig. Wenn ein Geb√§ude √ºber die Relation boundedBy auf _BoundarySurface Objekte verweist, haben diese eine LOD2, LOD3 oder LOD4 Geometrie. Damit hat das Geb√§ude automatisch eine entsprechende Repr√§sentation. EN: B is trivial. When a building has a BoundarySurface over the boundedBy relation, they should have either an LoD2,LoD3 or LoD4 Geometry. This guarantees that the building has such a representation.

[I.3] (C): if the boundedBy property is used to geometrically model the outer surface, The geometry representation of the building itself as volume or surface model should always reference existing geometry surface elements from the boundarySurface.

Difficult to check this with Schematron. We could check that IF the boundedBy property is used and IF there is Solid or MultiSurface (not under the boundedBy property) geometry that these geometries contain at least (say) ONE XLink. Its not possible with schematron to check if that XLink is then actually referencing a surface under the boundedBy property.. And its also not possible to test whether ALL the geometries specified under the boundedBy property are being referenced by the Solid or MultiSurface geometry.

(A) Starting from LOD2, curve parts of the building shell may be represented using the lodXMultiCurve, X ‚àà [2..4], property of _AbstractBuilding. This property shall not be used if the building is only represented in LOD1.

Source	CityGML 2.0 10.3.9 (5), p. 78
Interpretation	
[I.1] (A): If a building has only LoD1 geometry (either Solid or MultiSurface but not both per CO-bldg:BU-003), the lodXMultiCurve, X ‚àà [2..4] property shall not be used. (This rule is NOT being covered by schema conformity: it is perfectly valid by the schema to give a building only lod1 geometry and use a property lod2MultiCurve, lod3MultiCurve or lod4MultiCurve, or even all of them for that matter.)

[I.2] (A): DE: Diese Regel ist √ºberfl√ºssig, da sie bereits mit der Schema-Konformit√§t erf√ºllt ist. EN: this rule is redundant because it is covered by the schema.

NOTE : [I.1] and [I.2] are incompatible. If we decide on [I.2], [D.1] should be removed since it is the definition following [I.1]

Definition	
[D.1] from [I.1]: If a building has only LoD1 geometry (either Solid or MultiSurface but not both per CO-bldg:BU-003), the lodXMultiCurve, X ‚àà [2..4] property shall not be used.

(A) Starting from LOD3, openings of _BoundarySurface elements may be modelled using the opening property (type: OpeningPropertyType) of _BoundarySurface. This property shall not be used for _BoundarySurface elements only represented in LOD2.

(B) Accordingly, the surface geometry representing a _BoundarySurface in LOD2 must be simply connected.

(C) The opening property of _BoundarySurface may contain or reference _Opening elements. If the geometric location of an _Opening element topologically lies within a surface component of the _BoundarySurface, the opening must also be represented as inner hole of that surface.

(D) The embrasure surface of an _Opening element shall belong to the relevant adjacent _BoundarySurface.

Source	CityGML 2.0 10.3.9 (8), p. 79
Interpretation	
[I.1] (A): if a BoundarySurface element consists of lod3 geometry, it may contain an opening element which references lod3 geometry. If a BoundarySurface element consists of lod4 geometry, it may contain an opening element which references lod4 geometry.

[I.2] (B): the surface geometry representing a _BoundarySurface in LOD2 must be simply connected. The term simply connected is a little problematic in this context since it is possible to form a BoundarySurface of four polygons which are individually all simply connected. However, by connecting them in a way similar to the image below, it becomes a donut-like object which is not simply connected in 3D anymore. Since we can make a "circle" following the long sides of each polygon and if we contract that to a single point we leave the object (we end in the middle). However what is probably meant here is that BoundarySurfaces should not contain a hole. So no innerRing allowed. But it is also possible to make a hole without explicitly modelling it, so restricting innerRings is also not sufficient. Furthermore, and perhaps more importantly: in LoD2 we can model dormers (outerBuildingInstallations) on the roofs which also require a hole in the roof. This conformance requirement is thus considered to be erroneous.

[I.3] (C): If an opening property of a _BoundarySurface is used to model an opening, and that opening lies geometrically within any of the surfaces of that _BoundarySurface, that specific surface should model an inner hole at the place of the opening. This is a geometrical test and can not be tested for with Schematron.

[I.4] (D): The embrasure (DE: Laibung) of an _Opening element shall belong to the relevant _BoundarySurface and not to the _Opening. This is a geometrical test and can not be tested for with Schematron. Even a geometric test can only heuristically solve this issue, it is a modelling guideline and not a conformance requirement.

Definition	
[D.1] from [I.1]: if a BoundarySurface is only modelled in LoD2 and not in higher LoDs, it shall not be having an opening property

(A) Starting from LOD4, the interiorRoom property (type: InteriorRoomPropertyType) of _AbstractBuilding may be used to semantically model the free space inside the building by Room elements. This property shall not be used if the building is only represented in LOD 1 ‚Äì 3.

(B) The Room element may be geometrically represented as a surface or volume model, using its lod4Solid or lod4MultiSurface property (gml:SolidPropertyType resp. gml:MultiSurfacePropertyType).

(C) In addition, different parts of the visible surface of a room may be modelled by thematic _BoundarySurface elements. Only FloorSurface, CeilingSurface, InteriorWallSurface, and ClosureSurface as subclasses of _BoundarySurface are allowed.

(D) If the visible surface of a room is represented by _BoundarySurface elements, an additional geometric representation as volume or surface model using the lod4Solid and 'lod4MultiSurface property shall not explicitly define the geometry, but has to reference the according components of the gml:MultiSurface element of _BoundarySurface using the XLink concept of GML 3.1.1.

Interpretation

[I.2] (B): Room element may be represented as a surface, volume or both (covered by schema)

[I.3] (C): If a Room is referencing _BoundarySurfaces, it may use only: FloorSurface, CeilingSurface, InteriorWallSurface, and ClosureSurface

(A) Starting from LOD4, the interiorBuildingInstallation property (type: IntBuildingInstallationPropertyType) of _AbstractBuilding may be used to represent immovable objects inside the building that are permamently attached to the building structure.

(B) The interiorBuildingInstallation property shall not be used if the building is only represented in LOD 1 ‚Äì 3.

(C) Furthermore, the interiorBuildingInstallation property shall only be used if the object cannot be associated with a Room element. In the latter case, the roomInstallation property (type: IntBuildingInstallationPropertyType) of the corresponding Room element shall be used to represent the object.

Source	CityGML 2.0 10.3.9 (10), p. 79
Interpretation	
[I.1] (A): interiorBuildingInstallation may be used to represent immovable objects inside the building: not formalizable because "immovable objects" is not something that can be checked

[I.2] (A): If there is no LoD4 geometry (either LoD4Solid, Lod4MultiSurface, or both per CO-bldg:BU-003 [3]), there may not be a interiorBuildingInstallation. This is NOT part of the schema.

[I.3] (B): Coincides with [2]

(A) The boundedBy property (type: BoundarySurfacePropertyType) of the element _AbstractBuilding may contain a _BoundarySurface element inline or an XLink reference to a remote _BoundarySurface element using the XLink concept of GML 3.1.1.

(B) In the latter case, the xlink:href attribute of the boundedBy property may only point to a remote_BoundarySurface element (where remote _BoundarySurface elements are located in another document or elsewhere in the same document).

Source	CityGML 2.0 10.3.9 (12), p. 79
Interpretation	
[I.1] (A): This is already covered in the schema. All property elements that are the subject of the referential integrity requirements have a reference to gml:AssociationAttributeGroup which references in turn the simpleLink attribute group which defines the xlink:href attribute (among others)

[I.2] (B): In case an XLink is used, it should be resolvable and checked on validity (is the right element referenced?). This can never be done with schematron or any other xml technology since the URI can point to anything. Some dedicated software will be needed for such purposes.

[I.3] (C): This is covered by the Schematron schema given here: http://schemas.opengis.net/citygml/schematron/2.0/referentialIntegrity.sch
