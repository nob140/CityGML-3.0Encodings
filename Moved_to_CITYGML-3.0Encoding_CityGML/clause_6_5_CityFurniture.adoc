=== CityFurniture

The CityFurniture module supports representation of city furniture objects. City furniture objects are immovable objects like lanterns, traffic signs, advertising columns, benches, or bus stops that can be found in traffic areas, residential areas, on squares, or in built-up areas.

The concepts of the CityFurniture module are defined in the OGC CityGML 3.0 Conceptual Model standard. The UML diagram for the City Furniture module is available under https://docs.ogc.org/is/20-010/20-010.html#cityfurniture-uml[^], the Data Dictionary is available under https://docs.ogc.org/is/20-010/20-010.html#toc51[^].

The CityFurniture Conformance Class implements the following Requirements Class from the CityGML 3.0 Conceptual Model Standard:

* CityFurniture: http://www.opengis.net/spec/CityGML-1/3.0/req/req-class-cityfurniture

The applicable GML schema is http://schemas.opengis.net/citygml/cityfurniture/3.0/cityFurniture.xsd[cityFurniture.xsd^].

==== Dependencies

The CityFurniture Requirements Class is dependent on the following Requirements Class from this standard:

* The <<core-section,Core>> Requirements Class which is the only mandatory Requirements Class. This class contains foundational elements upon which a CityGML dataset is built. The <<core-section,Core>> Requirements Class also defines XML elements and types reused by other Requirements Classes.

==== Implementation Decisions

The following decisions have been made regarding implementation of the CityGML 3.0 CityFurniture conformance class in GML:

. All associations allow by default that the referenced features can be provided inline or by reference.

==== Requirements

The CityGML CityFurniture XML elements and their corresponding CityGML UML classes are listed in <<city-furniture-xml-elements>>. In addition, the CityGML CityFurniture XML elements are documented in the GML schema http://schemas.opengis.net/citygml/cityfurniture/3.0/cityFurniture.xsd[cityFurniture.xsd^] and in this https://opengeospatial.github.io/CityGML-3.0Encodings/xsd-doc/3.0/cityFurniture/[XML Schema documentation^].
