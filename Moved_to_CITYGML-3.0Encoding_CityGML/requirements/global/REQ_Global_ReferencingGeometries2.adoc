^|*Requirement  {counter:req-id}* |*/req/global/referencinggeometries2*
2+|Referencing geometries of spaces and space boundaries is subject to the following restrictions:
^|A |Geometries stored inline a space boundary SHALL NOT be redundantly stored as geometry of a space. If the geometry shall be stored with the space in addition, it SHALL reference the geometry from the space boundary using XLinks.
^|B |Space boundaries SHALL NOT reference geometries of a space using XLinks.
^|C |Rules A and B apply for all spaces and space boundaries that are children of the same top-level feature.
2+|Note 1: The rationale of requirement A is to avoid duplicate geometries. It does NOT imply that a space has to reference all geometries of its space boundaries using XLinks. For example, the geometry can also be stored only with the space boundaries. +
Note 2: If the space does not have space boundaries, then the geometry is stored with the space and no XLinks are required.
