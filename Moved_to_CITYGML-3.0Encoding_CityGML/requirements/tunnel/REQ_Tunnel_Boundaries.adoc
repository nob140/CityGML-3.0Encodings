2+|<<tunnel-boundaries-table>> lists the surfaces that are allowed as thematic surface boundaries of the space elements defined in the Tunnel module. If a space element is bounded by thematic surface boundaries using the property _core:boundary_ (type: _core:AbstractSpaceBoundaryPropertyType_), the property SHALL contain exactly one surface element from <<tunnel-boundaries-table>> that is supported for the specific space element. If no surface element is supported, the space element SHALL NOT be bounded by thematic surface boundaries.
